# Perceptron Binary Classifier

A simple perceptron implementation for classifying positive and negative numerical values.

## Overview
This project implements a single-layer perceptron, one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks, capable of binary classification (positive vs negative values). It serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental machine learning concepts.

## Features
- Pure Python implementation with NumPy for vector operations
- Binary classification (positive/negative)
- Training progress visualization
- Decision Boundary Plotting

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- pip

### Setup
Clone the repository:

   git clone
